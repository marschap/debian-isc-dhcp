      client requests from the server to play nicely with the samba
      package.
    - Prevent dh_md5sums from creating a md5sums file for dhcp3-client-udeb.
  * Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>:
    - Switch to using a Debian-specific dhclient-script, rather than
      patching upstream's "linux" one
    - More or less rewrite dhclient-script
      - Clean up accumulated shell nastiness
      - Improve readability
      - Be careful when handling resolv.conf, to avoid breaking it
        if something goes wrong (Closes: #211261)
      - New resolv.conf handling is also symlink-friendly (Closes: #177846)
      - Treat a hostname of "(none)" the same as a null hostname
        (Closes: #165086)
      - Still proceed with resolver configuration if nameservers are available
        but a domain name is not (Closes: #110927)
      - Use exit status 2, rather than 1, to indicate that binding failed,
        so that unrelated errors do not result in DHCPDECLINE (your ISP will
        thank you)
    - Don't let a failing dhcp3-server init script abort installation; it
      will usually be unconfigured on new installations (Closes: #217769)
    - Increase IP TTL for DHCP packets from 16 to 128 (Closes: #152287)
    - Apply patch from Christian Perrier <bubulle@debian.org> to switch to
      using po-debconf (Closes: #208549)
    - Have dhcpd chdir to / as a well-behaved daemon should
      (Closes: #95262)

dhcp3 (3.0+3.0.1rc11-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * We now source the scripts in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-{exit,enter}-hooks.d
    instead of executing them. Updated the sample debug-enter and
    debug-exit scripts to accomodate this change. Thanks go to Thomas
    Hood for the patch, the patience and the perseverance :)
    (closes: #171798, #196476)
  * Added debconf question for dhcp3-relay options. Thanks to Ralf
    Heiringhoff <rh@mediaways.net> for the patch. (closes: #165054)
  * Several changes to /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-script:
      - Source hooks instead of executing them (see above).
      - Call logger if one hook returns a non-zero exit status.
      - Not exporting dhclient-script's variables since we are now
        sourcing instead of executing.
  * Fixed /etc/init.d/dhcp3-server so it returns an error code of 1 if
    dhcpd can't start. Thanks to Alexander R. Perlis <aprl@math.arizona.edu>.
    Closes: #198992.

  * Exit with an exit status of 0 in /etc/init.d/dhcp3-server if

    be called with a "stop" argument and package removal does not
    fail if this file does not exist. (closes: #184943 - missing

    (Closes: #144666)

dhcp3 (3.0+3.0.1rc8-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-script now exports all important variables
    so the scripts in the .d directories have a clue of what's going
    on. See the debug-enter and debug-exit scripts in the .d
    directories for an example of what's available.
  * Fixed location of dhclient-script in the sample dhclient.conf (it
    was commented out, but just in case :)
  * Got rid of Wichert's rebindsignal patch as I think it is not
    needed for ISC DHCP version 3 (we have OMAPI now to control lots of
    things in dhclient's behavior.)
  * We are not calling anymore update-inetd to enable and disable bootps
    in dhcp3-server's postinst and postrm scripts respectively. This is
    historical baggage that we don't even now why it is there. So,
    we don't need to depend on netbase and people don't have to have
    inetd to be able to use the DCHP server. (Closes: #143337)

  * Commenting out all subnet declarations in the sample

  * Hacked dhcpd.c so 'ddns-update-style' defaults to 'none' in the
    absence of this statement in the dhcpd.conf config. file.
    This gets rid of the misleading ddns-update-style message that
    shows up in the syslog. (Closes: #138677)
  * Added debconf note to clarify new non-authoritative behavior.
  * Make dhclient-script run the enter and exit hooks as documented in
    the man pages. In addition to this we are providing two
    directories where admins. can put additional scripts to be run
    by run-parts. (Closes: #139546)
  * Renamed binaries once again: dhcpd-3.x -> dhcpd3, etc. Renamed man

    (Closes: #139071, #139134)

  * /etc/init.d/dhcp: got rid of the flag that prevents dhcp from starting

    a valid /etc/dhcpd.conf was configured. Change requested by Joy
    on #debian-devel. I need to figure out a better way of handling this
    but right now I don't have time. Any bugs because of this will

  * Removed comment misleading comment in /etc/init.d/dhcp. I plan to move
    to debconf soon and then people will be able to specify the interfaces
    on which to run DHCP.
    Closes: #71310: /etc/init.d/dhcp has misleading comments.

dhcp (3.0b2pl5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Dropped patch to client/scripts/linux and that solved #66173
    (dhcp-client: dhclient-script doesn't do what its manpage says) in
    3.0b1pl17-1 because the patch is in this new upstream version.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Sep 2000 18:43:39 -0400

dhcp (3.0b2pl3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (never knew about 3.0b2pl2.)
  * Added the -q switch to the invocation of the dhcp* daemons (dhcpd,
    dhclient, and dhcrelay) in the corresponding /etc/init.d/dhcp*
    script (dhcpd, dhcp-client and dhcp-relay) so programs don't print
    a lot of junk when they start.
    Closes: Bug#71309 - dhcpd wraper should call with -q.
    Closes: Bug#59280 - dhcp: Too verbose.
  * Added code to /etc/init.d/dhcp-client to test if the new scheme for
    network configuration is being used (the /etc/network/* stuff). If
    this is the case then the init.d script just exists without doing
    anything.
    Closes: Bug#61092 - dhclient loads twice under new interfaces
       configuration.

dhcp (3.0b2pl1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. This is the "first official release to
    include the DHCP Failover Protocol, OMAPI, and a few other goodies."
    Not recomended for production environments yet, though.
  * Dynamic DNS is now compiled in.
  * 2.0.x Linux kernels are not supported anymore, the binaries in this
    package will not run in a system running a 2.0.x kernel. Enough is
    enough people, please upgrade to a 2.2.x or 2.4.x kernel. I am tired
    of maintaining this backward compatibility baggage. There are not
    wrapper scripts anymore and no build tricks to support the 2.0.x
    kernels.
  * Updated README.Debian.

dhcp (3.0b1pl17-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Same changes as in 2.0pl3-3.
  * Call the configure scripts as "/bin/sh debian/configure-xx" instead
    of just "debian/configure" so no non-executable scripts are found
    during building.
    Closes: Bug#68462 - dhcp: non-executable script during building.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Aug 2000 18:47:45 -0400

dhcp (3.0b1pl17-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Same changes as in 2.0pl3-2.
  * OK, I screwed it up: the fact that it is entirely possible to have
    a DHCP server and a DHCP client running at the same time in the same
    machine never crossed my mind, so I made each of the dhcp* packages
    conflict with each other in 2.0pl3-1. Big mistake! So I corrected
    that and just left dhcp-client to conflict with dhcpcd. I hope that
    nobody is using ISC DHCP client and dhcpcd in the same machine and at
    the same time because I'm going to be pissed.
    Closes: Bug#68445: dhcp: shouldn't conflict with dhcp-client.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Aug 2000 23:46:07 -0400

dhcp (3.0b1pl17-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Same changes as in dhcp-2.0pl3-1 which is being uploaded to unstable
    (woody.)
  * Made /etc/init.d/dhcp-client a conffile to prevent an overwrite at
    install time without the user knowing it. In the future I will use
    debconf to take care of interface configuration.
    Closes: Bug#67873: dhcp-client: init.d script is overwritten on upgrade.
  * Applied patch from Jun Hamano <junio@siamese.dhis.twinsun.com> to
    fix kernel version identifiaction problems in /etc/dhclient-script
    (thanks Jun!)
    Closes: #66472: dhcp-client: /etc/dhclient-script bugfix.
  * Applied patch from steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca to fix problems
    reported in bug #66173 (thanks Steve!) Also, fixed dhclient.conf(5)
    to reference dhclient.leases(8) instead of dhclient-lease(8) as well
    as dhclient-script in the description of the "script" statement.
    Closes: #66173: dhcp-client: dhclient-script doesn't do what its 
    manpage says.
  * Added to the control section of the dhcp-client package a conflict
    with the dhcpcd package.
    Closes: #65524: dhcp-client needs a "conflicts" with dhcpcd.
  * Made each of the dhcp* packages (dhcp, dhcp-relay and dhcp-client)
    conflict with each other so only one of them can be installed at
    the same time.
  * Now dhcp-options(5) is installed in each of the dhcp* packages.
    Closes: #61716: dhcp-client: dhcp-options(5) man page missing.

dhcp (3.0b1pl13-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * I screwed the way I am building the binaries for Linux 2.0.x and
    Linux 2.2.x when I first packaged the 3.0 beta series of ISC DHCP.
    The reason was that the configure script changed between the 2.0 and 
    the 3.0 series so I can't do what I was doing in the 2.0 series to
    build both Linux 2.0.x and 2.2.x versions. I ended adding a dirty
    hack (creating configure-2.0.x and configure-2.2.x scripts) that
    I hope to get rid of in the future by hacking the original configure
    script.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Wed,  9 Feb 2000 07:52:26 -0500

dhcp (3.0b1pl12-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * I finally found some time to package the latest development version
    of the ISC DHCP package, which promises lots of new cool features.
    I don't plan to upload this to Potato as dhcp-beta, dhcp-client-beta,
    etc. packages because I don't like the mess this creates. Instead,
    I'll upload this to project/experimental and when 3.0 final hits the
    streets I'll just upload to unstable.
  * There's no CHANGES file in the 3.0 sources - made the appropriate change
    to debian/rules.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Dec 1999 00:32:29 -0500

dhcp (2.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The sample /etc/dhclient.conf is now provided completely commented
    out so existing installations are not broken after upgrading
    to dhcp-client 2.0-3 and above.
    (Closes: Bug#50592: default dhclient.conf is a killer).

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Nov 1999 21:34:29 -0500

dhcp (2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compiled two sets of binaries: one for 2.0.x kernels and another
    one for 2.2.x kernels. Created three wrapper scripts (dhcpd,
    dhclient, and dhcrelay) that call the appropiate version
    depending on the version of the running kernel. I also needed
    to tweak dhcp's init.d script to accomodate for the change (now
    I am calling "start-stop-daemon --stop" with the --pid-file argument
    and not with bot the --pid-file and the --exec arguments.
    Closes: Bug#41974 (dhcp requires kernel 2.2??)
  * Took care of the /usr/doc/* -> /usr/share/doc/* move (had to
    tweak the postinst and prerm scripts to take care of the link since
    I am not letting debhelper generate these scripts automatically).
  * Man pages now installed in /usr/share/man/.
  * Fixed a little the init.d script for dhcp-relay, although this file
    was so broken that I believe nobody is using this package.
  * Fixed a minor typo in the sample server/dhcpd.conf file 
    ("domain-name-servers" instead of "name-servers").
  * s/reload/restart/g in /etc/init.d/dhcp.
  * Updated README.Debian and descriptions in debian/control.
  * Removed Bashism from /etc/dhclient-script.
    Closes: Bug#44977 (Bashism in /etc/dhclient-script)
  * Included /etc/dhclient.conf and made it a conffile for dhcp-client.
    Closes: Bug#45537 (significant error in dhclient man pages)
  * Added a /etc/init.d/dhcp-client script. The script won't start
    dhclient if /sbin/cardmgr exists (this normally means
    that PCMCIA is installed and that dhclient will be started by the
    cardmgr daemon). The script is run early in the boot sequence.
    Closes: Bug#48952 (missing /etc/init.d/dhcp-client?)

dhcp (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    to update the rc links to /etc/init.d/dhcp-beta.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Feb 1999 13:32:13 -0400

dhcp-beta (2.0b1pl14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (temporary, while Rich Sahlender is out of scene).
  * New upstream version.
  * Moved from debstd to debhelper.
  * Modified /etc/init.d/dhcp-beta to start/stop dhcpd by using the
    PID file /var/run/dhcpd.pid.
  * Re-worked a lot debian/rules (I actually wrote it again from scratch).
  * The patches in the last NMU done by Vincent Renardias <vincent@waw.com>
    are not included since I tested dhclient and it ran just fine. Please
    give this new version a shot and let me know of any problems.

dhcp-beta (2.0b1pl6-0.1) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload that fixes "important" bugs #24445 ([SECURITY]
    dhcp-beta: potential buffer overflow problems) and #24442
    (/etc/init.d/dhcp-beta sources inexistent /etc/init.d/functions).
  * New upstream release (this new release is what solves bug #24445).
  * Removed from /etc/init.d/dhcp sourcing of /etc/init.d/functions because
    this file is obsolete and is not present in newer Debian releases
    (>= 2.0). This fixes #24442 and #19654 (/etc/init.d/functions should
    not be used).
  * Changed _PATH_DHCPD_DB in dhcpd.h to /var/dhcp/dhcpd.leases (it was
    /var/lib/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases, which we are not using anymore). So,
    now the leases database will be in /var/dhcp/dhcpd.leases. No more
    files in /var/dhcpd/ nor /var/lib/dhcpd/.
  * Changed VARDB (in the linux-2.0 section of Makefile.dist) to be
    /var/dhcp/ instead of /var/dhcpd/ (this was done to support the
    change of the leases database to /var/dhcp/). The consequence of this
    is that /var/dhcpd/ is not provided in the .deb anymore (which is
    fine because this directory is not used).
  * Defined PATH_DHCPD_DB as a constant equal to "/var/dhcp/dhcpd.leases"
    in the postinst. Used this constant in all references to the leases
    database througout the postinst.
  * s%ETCDIR%/etc/%g, s%DBDIR%/var/dhcp/%g and s%RUNDIR%/var/run/%g in
    dhcpd.8 and dhcpd.leases.5, so the man pages show the correct directory.
  * The last 4 changes fix #23089 (/var/lib/dhcpd does not exist so dhcpd 
    can't start).
  * Made the default _not_ to run dhcpd. This was done by setting run_dhcpd
    to 0 in the default /etc/init.d/dhcp.
  * Change comments that are printed out in the last part of the postinst
    to explain that editing of /etc/dhcpd.conf and /etc/init.d/dhcp is
    necessary in order to be able to run dhcpd.
  * Fixed a small typo in /etc/init.d/dhcp (diasble -> disable).
  * Added the word "server" to the short description of dhcp-beta in
    the control file. This fixes #17558 (dhcp-beta: unclear description).
